<h1>ThisMovieIs</h1> A place for true movie lovers.
For those who have watched hundreds of films and one day realized that most modern movies are just repetitions of each other — the same plot twists, cliché characters, and predictable endings.
We created a platform where details are valued — because it’s the details that distinguish mediocrity from real cinema. <br>
<br>ThisMovieIs offers four ways to discover films: <br>
<br>
1. Search through movie selections made by cinephiles. <br>
2. Search by top ratings based on cinephile votes. <br>
3. Search in the “New Releases” category — usually films currently playing in theaters. <br>
4. Traditional search by categories and titles, powered by custom algorithms. <br>
<br>
Below is detailed information about each type of search.

    <p>It’s no secret that some people are truly passionate about cinema — they watch movies almost every day and have seen thousands of them. Over time, they develop a refined sense of taste, easily distinguishing mediocre films from truly high-quality and meaningful ones. To find such people, simply visit the <b>“Top Users”</b> section and choose a cinephile whose taste matches your own.</p>

    <p>The main difference between this type of search and traditional platforms like YouTube or IMDb is the <b>personal approach</b>. Here, selections are made not by algorithms or the averaged ratings of thousands of users, but by real people who carefully choose each film. On YouTube or IMDb, a high rating usually means that the movie is simply “okay” and liked by the majority.</p>

    <p><b>Here — it’s the opposite:</b> the top lists will differ greatly from mainstream media, as they reflect the personal preferences of true movie enthusiasts.</p>

    <p><b>Most importantly, every user’s top list is unique.</b> While other platforms feature the same lists for months or even years, ours are dynamic and ever-changing: tastes evolve, new discoveries appear, and rankings update along with them.</p>
